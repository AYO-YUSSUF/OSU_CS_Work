This is schoolwork done at Oregon State University.

deepEqual/reducers:

    Basic Javascript functions.  One to check if two objects are truly equal, the other to sum all the numeric values in an array

StockPages:

    A web app built using JavaScript, Express, and HTML.  Serves up 3 webpages: a home page, a page where you can check prices of individual stocks, and a page to order stocks.

ReactStoreApp:

    A single page web app built using JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS.  Displays a store where people can order food.  Mimics three separate webpages (home, order page, list of store locations) but really just rewrites the DOM with React when users choose to move to different pages.
